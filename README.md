JavaScript versus Research Computing

I was originally going to call this book *JavaScript for Scientists and Engineers*,
but [David Beazley thought][beazley-tweet] that "versus" would be a better title.
I hope I can convince you otherwise–that modern JavaScript is usable as well as useful–but
it's still funny.
I also hope that what I've written will be useful to everyone who does research computing,
from astronomers and ecologists to librarians and humanities scholars.
