## Who You Are

**Bhadra** received a B.Sc. in microbiology five years ago,
and has worked since then for a biotech firm with labs in four countries.
She did a statistics class using R as an undergrad,
then learned some more R and some Unix shell scripting
in a [Software Carpentry][swc] workshop,
but has no other training as a programmer.

Bhadra's team is developing tools
to detect structural similarities between proteins.
They would like to build a browser interface to their tools
so that people can test different algorithms on various data sets.
This book will show Bhadra how to build, test, and deploy that interface.

**Efraim** did fieldwork for the Ministry of Natural Resources for thirty-one years.
He learned Visual Basic so that he could write Excel macros,
then mastered C in order to maintain the control software
for some second-hand remote sensing equipment.

Efraim recently retired,
and is now an active member of several citizen science projects.
This book will show him how to create a service
to share those projects' data with the world,
and how to build a web-based administrative interface for it.
