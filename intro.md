## Who You Are

**Bhadra Basepair** received a B.Sc. in biochemistry five years ago,
and has worked since then for a biotech firm with labs in four countries.
She did a statistics class using R as an undergrad,
and has learned some more R and some Unix shell scripting on the job,
but has no other training as a programmer.

Bhadra's team is developing tools
to detect structural similarities between proteins.
They would like to build a browser interface to their tools
so that peopl can test different algorithms on various data sets.
This book will show Bhadra how to build both the interface
and the back-end server needed to support it,
and how to test them both.
